        <p>Following years of speculation and anticipation, Rockstar confirmed in February 2022 that the game was in development. That September, footage from unfinished versions was leaked on the internet in what journalists described as one of the biggest leaks in the history of the video game industry. The game was formally revealed in December 2023 and is scheduled to be released in late 2025 for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

    <h2> Setting and characters
    </h2>
    <p>Grand Theft Auto VI is set in the fictional open world U.S. state of Leonida—based on Florida—which includes Vice City, a fictionalised version of Miami.[1][2][3] Vice City was previously featured in Grand Theft Auto (1997) and as the main setting of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002) and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories (2006).[4][5][6] The game world parodies contemporary American culture, with satirical depictions of social media and influencer culture, and references to Internet memes such as Florida Man.[7][8][9] The story follows a criminal duo: Lucia, the series's first female protagonist since 2000,[b] and her male partner;[a] the first trailer depicts Lucia as a prison inmate, and later evading custody with her partner.[2][16]

    <h2>Development and release
    </h2>    
    <p> Rockstar Games began preliminary work on Grand Theft Auto VI in 2014 after Grand Theft Auto V's release, and principal development started after Red Dead Redemption 2's release in 2018.[17][18] During its production, the game was code-named Project Americas.[18] Jason Schreier reported the game was "a moderately sized release" that would expand over time to avoid its predecessors' developer crunch,[19] and that it would feature two Bonnie and Clyde–inspired protagonists, including a Latina woman,[18] and "a significant online mode" akin to Grand Theft Auto Online.[17] He claimed the developers were cautiously subverting the series's trend of joking about marginalised groups.[18][20] In 2018, The Know reported that the game would be set primarily in Vice City and partly in South America,[21] and in 2021, Tom Henderson claimed its map could evolve akin to Fortnite.[22][23]
