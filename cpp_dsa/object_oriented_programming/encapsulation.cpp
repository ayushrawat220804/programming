/* theory of encapsulation
encapsulation - the process of enclosing within classes and objects the attributes and the methods.
in other words encapsulation allow wrapping up of data and function into a single unit.

advantage-
data hiding - restrictions of external access of features of a class
information hiding - the implementation details are not known to the user 
implementation independence - a change in the implementation is done easily without affecting the user's interface.
